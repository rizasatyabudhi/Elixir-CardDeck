* Module : collection of different functions
* There is no instance variable in FP
* We can have different function with the same name inside one module
* Tuple: is like an array, where each index has special meaning
  ** { *hand* , *deck* }
  ** in JS, we would have {hand:[],deck:[]}
* Pattern Matching: Variable assignment in Elixir
* Pipe Operator (|>) : a function that runs multiple function at once
